# Module 2 Design Patterns

## Task: 

Within the project from previous module need add:
* Lazy Initialization - error handling handlers from the server (too many results, page size or other exceptions);
* Singleton - error handler popup should be organized as singleton;
* Factory - necessary to implement a layer/factory responsible for requests to the server with GET, POST, PUT, etc methods;
* Proxy - necessary to implement a proxy layer above the factory, which would log all kinds of requests and transmitted parameters;
* Organize all code using MV_ Pattern.
